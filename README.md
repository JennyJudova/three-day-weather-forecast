---

## Getting Started

Use the clone button to download the game source code. In the terminal enter the following commands:

To install all the packages listed in the package.json:

`$ npm i`
or
`$ yarn`

Run the app in your localhost:

`$ npm run serve`
or
`$ yarn serve`

Check the console for any issues and if there are check the package.json for any dependancies missing

## API used

When more than one city has the same name the API chooses the larger of the two. So if you search for 'Perth' it will give the weather in Perth Australia, if you are searching for Perth in Scotland you should search for 'Perth, UK'
